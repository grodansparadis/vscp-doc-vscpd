# Setting up the System

The VSCP Daemon is a complex software which can be configured to do many things and this may scare you off at first. If you try to grasp it all at the same time you will probably fail. But if you give it some time you will find that the system is divided in some simple logical parts. Take on on a small part and make that work before you continue to the next. *If you want to eat an elephant you have to do it by taking one bite at the time.* There is no other way.
