# TCP/IP Link interface protocol description

## Port

Default Port for the tcp/ip interface is 9598 but the interface can be available on several port and several interfaces on a specific hardware.

## Command and response format

The VSCP TCP protocol is very much like the POP3 protocol.

*  A command is sent (ending with CRLF)

*  A response line is received starting with either ”**+OK**” for success or ”**-OK**” for failure. The initial “token” is followed by some descriptive text that is separated from the initial token with “ - “ (a dash with a space on it's both sides).

For some commands there can be data in between the two lines. For instance the “**VERS**” command looks like this

    send: 'VERS<CR><LF>
    received line 1: '1,0,0<CR><LF>
    received line 2: '+OK - <CR><LF>

## VSCP Link Interfaces (VSCP-LI)

The daemon interface can be visible also on lower end (typically TC/IP) nodes. A subset of the commands are required to be available on such a node. Commands marked with yes in the link column below are the ones that a link node must have. All others are not mandatory on this type of nodes.

## NOOP - No operation :id=tcpip-noop

 This operation does nothing. It just replies with ”**+OK**”.

##  QUIT - Close the connection :id=tcpip-quit

Close the connection to the host.


##  HELP - Give help :id=tcpip-help

'HELP' alone gives help about all commands. 'HELP command" gives command specific help.

## USER - Username for login :id=tcpip-user

Used to enter username for a password protected server.

Used on the following form:

    USER username<CR><LF>

## PASS - Password for login :id=tcpip-pass

Used to enter username for a password protected server.

Used on the following form:

    PASS password<CR><LF>

## CHALLENGE - Get challenge session id :id=tcpip-challenge

Used to get a session unique id

Used on the following form:

    CHALLENGE password<CR><LF>

and give a response such as

    +OK - e14712fa9d6a62ff388a701848e24a32

where "e14712fa9d6a62ff388a701848e24a32" is the 32 byte sid.

## RESTART - Restart daemon :id=tcpip-restart

Restart the daemon. Must have highest privilege to be able to do this.

##  SHUTDOWN - Shutdown daemon :id=tcpip-shutdown

shutdown the daemon. Must have highest privilege to be able to do this.

## SEND - Send an event :id=tcpip-send

Used on the following form:

    send head,class,type,obid,datetime,timestamp,GUID,data1,data2,data3....
or
    send $variablename


**Important note** datetime is introduced in version *1.12.20.0*

The GUID is given on the form MSB-byte:MSB-byte-1:MSB-byte-2……. The GUID can also be given as ”-” in which case the GUID of the interface is used for the event. This GUID is constructed from the Ethernet MAC address and some other parameters to be globally unique.

**datetime** is UTC date time (Coordinated Universal Time) on ISO format
    YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:DD
Can be empty left empty and in that case the current UTC date/time is set by the system.

If timestamp is a relative time in microseconds. It can be empty in which case a timestamp will be set by the system. Before version *1.12.20.0* a timestamp of zero would be replaced by a system set timestamp this is not the case anymore.

Note: obid is just a place holder here to have a similar line as the receive command and is used internally by the daemon as an interface index. The value you use will always be overwritten by the daemon. head is currently not used.

CLASS=512 - CLASS=1023 is treated in a special way by the daemon. If you use the interface GUID as the first sixteen data bytes the event will only be set through that interface. This is the correct way to send a Level I event through the daemon. You can send Level I events without the GUID also but in that case the event will be sent out on all interfaces and as each interface can have nodes with this nickname all will be affected.

The variable send form makes it possible to send the content in a variable that is of type event. In this case give the name of the variable as argument preceded with a dollar ('$') sign.

**head** is defined as
    bit 7,6,5 priority => Priority 0-7 where 0 is highest.
    bit 4 = hard coded, true for a hard coded device.
    bit 3 = Don't calculate CRC, Set to zero to use CRC.
    bit 2 = Undefined.
    bit 1 = Undefined.
    bit 0 = Undefined.

**Example:**
Send a full GUID event

    send 0,20,3,,,,0:1:2:3:4:5:6:7:8:9:10:11:12:13:14:15,0,1,35<CR><LF>

Send Event. The example is the same as above but the GUID of the interface will be used.

    send 0,20,3,,,,-,0,1,35<CR><LF>

Send event with UTC time set

    send 0,20,3,,2001-11-02T18:00:01,,-,0,1,35<CR><LF>

Both send the [CLASS1.INFORMATION TYPE=3 ON event](http://docs.vscp.org/spec/latest/#/./class2.level1.information1), for zone=1, sub-zone=35

**Send event to specific interface**
It is possible to send Level I events to a specific interface. To do this use the Level II mirror Level I events ( Class=512-1023 VSCP Level II Level I events - CLASS2.LEVELI). This is events with class equal to 512 - 1023 which mirrors the Level I events but have the destination GUID in data bytes 0-15. Thees data-bytes is set to the interface (14 upper bits) and the node-ID for the node one wants to communicate with is in GUID[0]. This event will be sent to the correct interface.

So the above example would be

    send 0,20,3,,,0,-,15,14,13,12,11,10,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,0,0,1,35<CR><LF>

where class becomes *532* (512 + 20) and where *15,14,13,12,11,10,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,0,0* is the interface the events should be routed to. Note the two zeros at the two least significant bytes which is always zero for an interface and is used for node id's.


**Send content of variable**

    send $tempevent1

In this example the content of the variable tempevent1 is sent. The variable is of type event.

## RETR - Retrieve one or several event(s) :id=tcpip-retr

This command can be used to retrieve one or several events from the input queue. Events are returned as

    head,class,type,obid,datetime,timestamp,GUID,data0,data1,data2,...........

**Important note** datetime was added in version *1.12.20.0*

GUID with MSB first.

Used on the following form:

    RETR 2<CR><LF>

which gives

    0,20,3,0,2001-11-02T17:43:15,0,FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FE:0:5:93:140:2:32:0:1
    0,20,4,0,2001-11-02T17:43:15,0,FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FE:0:5:93:140:2:32:0:1
    +OK - Success

If no events is available in the queue


	-OK - No event(s) available


is received by the client.

If you try to fetch more events then there are in the queue you will get

    retr 100
    0,1,1,4,2001-11-02T17:43:15,0,FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:F5:00:04:00:00
    0,1,1,4,2001-11-02T17:43:15,0,FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:F5:00:04:00:00
    0,1,1,4,2001-11-02T17:43:15,0,FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:F5:00:04:00:00
    0,1,1,4,2001-11-02T17:43:15,0,FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:F5:00:04:00:00
    0,1,1,4,2001-11-02T17:43:15,0,FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:F5:00:04:00:00
    0,1,1,4,2001-11-02T17:43:15,0,FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:F5:00:04:00:00
 1. OK - No event(s) available

You request 100 events but there is only 6 available so you get a negative reply.

VSCP Event originating from a CANAL driver have the nickname of the node in the LSB of the GUID ( GUID[15] ). The rest of the GUID is the GUID for the interface.

If no argument is given one event is fetched even if there are more in the queue.

If you try to receive more events then there is events in the buffer -OK will be returned after the available number of events have been retrieved and been listed.

## RCVLOOP - Send events to client as soon as they arrive :id=tcpip-rcvloop

This command set the channel in a closed loop that only can be interrupted by a client closing the connection or by sending the CLOSELOOP command. The server will now send out an event as soon as it is reserved. This is done in a very effective way with high throughput. This means the client does not have to poll for new events. It just open one channel where it sends events and do control tasks and one channel where it receive evens.

To help in determining that the line is alive

    +OK

is sent with a two second interval. The format for the event data is the same as for RETR command.

Some applications may not implement this feature and should output

    -OK - Command not implemented<CR><LF>

to indicate this.

## QUITLOOP - quit receiving loop :id=tcpip-quitloop

Quit a receive loop started by the RCVLOOP command.

## CDTA/CHKDATA - Check if there are events to retrieve :id=tcpip-chkdata

and reply is

    8 <CR><LF>
    +OK<CR><LF>

## CLRA/CLRALL - Clear all events in in-queue :id=tcpip-clrall

This command are used to clear all events in the input queue.

Used on the following form:

   CLRA<CR><LF>

and reply is

    +OK - All events cleared.<CR><LF>

## STAT - Get statistics information :id=tcpip-stat

Get interface statistics information. The returned format is

    x,y,z,cntReceiveData,cntReceiveFrames,cntTransmitData,cntTransmitFrames
