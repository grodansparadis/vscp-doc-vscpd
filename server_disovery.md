# Server/Service Discovery

Server discovery is a mechanism in VSCP used to discover servers in a system. A typical example can be a Bluetooth device that connects to a segment of nodes. A client can send a probe on this device to discover available servers. 

The alternative to the use of the discovery mechanism is to wait for devices to identify themselves with there heartbeats and server capability events.
