# Setting up the system on Beaglebone

[Beaglebone](https://beagleboard.org/bone) is a very nice board and VSCP & Friends is a perfect match for it if you are using distributions based on Debian wheezy or later.

VSCP & Friends has been tested and works very well on Beaglebone Black. The setup is the same as on other Unix systems so the instructions to [setup VSCP & Friends on a Unix system](./setting_up_the_system_on_unix.md) can be used.
