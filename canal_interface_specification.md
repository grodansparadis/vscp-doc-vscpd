# What is CANAL

CANAL (CAN Abstraction Layer) is a very simple approach to interfacing a CAN card or some other CAN hardware. It consists mostly of open, close, read, write and filter/mask handling. If you need to do more this is not the model for you and we recommend **CanPie** 

http://sourceforge.net/projects/canpie 

or **VCA** (Virtual CAN API) used in the OCERA project above 

http://www.ocera.org/download/components/WP7/canvca-0.01.html 

which are much more advanced, and capable implementations.

CANAL has been constructed from a need to use CAN in the form of control networks in the SOHO (Small Office/Home) environment. This kind of environment is totally different to the very tough automotive or industry control world where Canal probably would not be the best solution. The goal has not been to construct something that will take over the world just something that does solve a problem at hand. 

For CANAL there is some code available. First of all some drivers and also a daemon/service (VSCP Daemon) that can be used to simulate CAN networks on a PC, over Ethernet/TCP/IP etc. The daemon is available for both Windows and Linux and can be found at http://can.sourceforge.net.

CANAL is tightly coupled with the Very Simple Control Protocol, VSCP and the VSCP daemon. This is a protocol constructed for SOHO control situations. The model has been constructed as a two-layer model so that the VSCP Daemon can also be useful for people that are just  interested in CAN and not in VSCP. You can find more information about vscp at http://www.vscp.org.

CANAL is open and free to use with no restrictions, as is the above software, which is released under GPL/LGPL.

Current information about CANAL, the VSCP Daemon and VSCP (Very Simple Control Protocol) can be found at http://www.vscp.org and http://can.sourceforge.net. There are two mailinglists available on Sourceforge 

https://sourceforge.net/mail/?group_id=53560 

that are about CANAL (can_canal) and VSCP (can_vscp) topics.

# CANAL-API Specification





## long CanalOpen( const char *pConfigStr, unsigned long flags )

Opens a CAN channel.

### Params

####  pDevice
Physical device to connect to. This is the place to add device specific parameters and filters/masks. This is a text string. It can be a name, some parameters or whatever the interface creator chooses.
#### flags

Device specific flags with a meaning defined by the interface creator.



### Returns

Handle for open physical interface or < = 0 on error. 
For an interface where there is only one channel the handle has no special meaning and can only be looked upon as a status return parameter.




## int CanalClose( long handle  )

Close the channel and free all allocated resources associated with the channel.

### Params

handle – Handle for open physical interface.

### Returns

TRUE on success or FALSE if failure.





## unsigned long CanalGetLevel( long handle  )

### Params

handle – Handle for open physical interface.


### Returns

Returns the canal level this interface can handle.  An error is indicated by a zero return value. At the moment the following levels are defined

 | CANAL_LEVEL_STANDARD   | A starndard CANAL driver as of this specification.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | 
 | --------------------   | --------------------------------------------------                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | 
 | CANAL_LEVEL_USES_TCPIP | This driver does not respond to any of the methods, even if they must be implemented. The driver will instead use the TCP/IP interface of the VSCP daemon for its data transfer. This driver type is called a VSCP Level II driver because it is constructed to work just with VSCP Level II events which does not fit in standard CAN frames. This type of driver does not need any buffers as no data is exchanged through the interface. |

### Returns

Pointer to a vendor string.








## const char *  CanalGetDriverInfo( void )

This call returns a documentation object in XML form of the configuration string for the driver. This string and the flags setting and  can be used to help users to enter the configuration data in an application which allows for this.

The configuration string locks like

    pos0;pos1;pos2;pos3;pos4;....

that is items separated with semicolons. The **pos** attribute for the `<item>` tag is the ordinal for these. Always starting with base zero.

All items are sub strings when they are part of the configuration string but can be typed withing the `<item>` tag with the **type** attribute. Valid types are

 | Type        | Description                                                                              | 
 | ----        | -----------                                                                              | 
 | **string**  | The should be interpreted as a sting                                                     | 
 | **boolean** | The item should be interpreted as a boolean. Valid values are TRUE, FALSE, 0, 1          | 
 | **int32**   | A signed integer. The attributes **max** and **min** can be used to specify limits       | 
 | **uint32**  | An unsigned integer. The attributes **max** and **min** can be used to specify limits    | 
 | **float**   | A floating point value. The attributes **max** and **min** can be used to specify limits | 
 | **choice**  | Specify a list with choices that can be set                                              | 

The **optional** attribute tells if an item is optional. If set on a pos all items on positions after it must also be optional.

The `<flags>` tag describe the bits in the flags value. It should have a `<bit>` tag for each bit in the flags that have a meaning. The **width** attribute can be used to tell the width for a configurable item and in that case the bits affected are the bits from the value in **pos** to **pos+width**. Width defaults to one as expected.

# Message ID Flags

Each message has some flags set to give information about the events. The flags are defined as follow

 | Flag                  | Value      | Description                                                       | 
 | ----                  | -----      | -----------                                                       | 
 | CANAL_IDFLAG_STANDARD | 0x00000000 | Standard message id (11-bit)                                      | 
 | CANAL_IDFLAG_EXTENDED | 0x00000001 | Extended message id (29-bit)                                      | 
 | CANAL_IDFLAG_RTR      | 0x00000002 | RTR-Frame                                                         | 
 | CANAL_IDFLAG_STATUS   | 0x00000004 | This package is an error indication (data holds error code,id=0). | 
 | CANAL_IDFLAG_SEND     | 0x80000000 | Reserved for use by application software to indicate send.        | 

**CANAL_IDFLAG_SEND** may seam strange but can be very useful for software to use as a way to distinguish between sent and received frames.

CANAL_IDFLAG_STATUS can be used by CAN controllers to report status data back to a host or an application. At the moment  the following error codes are defined. All status events consist of four data bytes where the first byte tell the status code, the second is the receive error counter, the third the transmit error counter and the fourth byte is reserved and should be set to zero. 

 | Flag                     | Value | Description                                                                         |

 | CANAL_STATUSMSG_BUSOFF   | 0x04  | Device is in BUSOFF. CANAL_STATUSMSG_OK is sent when returning to operational mode. |
