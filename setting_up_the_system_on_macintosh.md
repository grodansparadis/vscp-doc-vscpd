# Setting up the system on Macintosh

Oh well this is not tested yet. The reason is we have no Macintosh hardware.  If you want to see this happen please consider sponsor us with some Macintosh hardware and we will make VSCP & Friends available also on this platform. 

Probably a standard [Linux/Unix installation](./setting_up_the_system_on_unix.md) will work though.
