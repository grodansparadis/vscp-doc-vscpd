# Read Event

`<code=css>`
    op=4 or op=READEVENT
`</code>`  

Read one or more VSCP Event(s). 

**Requires a valid session parameter**

**General format:**

`<code=css>`
http://server:port/rest?
    vscpsession=session-key&
    format=plain|csv|xml|json|jsonp&
    op=4|readevent
    [&count=n]
`</code>`

so to read a maximum of four events in plain format use

`<code=css>`
http://server:port/rest?vscpsession=session-key&
    format=plain&
    op=4&
    count=4
`</code>`

**Arguments:**


*  **op** - Set to 4|readevent

*  **format** - Can be 0|plain, 1|csv, 2|xml, 3|json or 4|jsonp.

*  **vscpsession** - A valid session key received from the open method.

*  **count** is an optional parameter and will, if not set, default to one.

## HTTP Request with GET

`<code=css>`
http://host:port/vscp/rest?vscpsession=d1c13eb83f52f319f14d167962048521 &format=plain|csv|xml|json|jsonp&op=4&readevent[&count=n]    
`</code>`

to test this with **curl** use the following format

`<code=css>`
curl -X GET "http://host:port/vscp/rest? \
    vscpsession=d1c13eb83f52f319f14d167962048521 & \
    format=plain|csv|xml|json|jsonp& \
    op=4|readevent[&count=n]"
`</code>`

or against the demo server in your browser

`<code=url>`
http://demo.vscp.org:8080/vscp/rest?vscpsession=98608c27b1ca33ceb6c7f003688c7095&format=plain&op=readevent&count=2
`</code>`

replacing the session key (98608c27b1ca33ceb6c7f003688c7095) with the key you received in the open call.

The result you get should be something like

    1 1 Success 
    2 events requested of 201 available (unfiltered) 2 will be retrieved
 1.  96,10,6,1,2003-11-02T12:01:01,1917354301,FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:F7:03:00:00:00:00:00:00:00,0x8A,0x81,0x00,0xE9/r/n
 2.  96,10,6,1,Important note datetime is introduced in version 1.12.20.0,2003-11-02T12:01:01,1917354551,FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:F7:03:00:00:00:00:00:00:00,0x8A,0x81,0x00,0xE7/r/n


## Examples

##### example GET HTTP request

`<code=css>`
    http://localhost:8080/vscp/rest?  
              vscpsession=d1c13eb83f52f319f14d167962048521&
              format=plain&
              op=4
`</code>`  


## HTTP Request with POST

`<code=css>`
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8080/vscp/rest" \
    -H "vscpsession: d1c13eb83f52f319f14d167962048521" \ 
    -d "op=readevent&format=plain&count=5"     
`</code>`

## Demo

There is a a [demo app.](https///github.com/grodansparadis/vscp-ux/tree/master/rest) in the source tree, that demonstrates this functionality using JavaScript.

### JavaScript Request with JSONP

`<code=JavaScript>`
*/*//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
// do_readEventOne
//
		
var do_readEventOne = function() {
			
    if ( VscpSessionKey.length > 0 ) {	
        $.ajax({
            url: VscpServer + '/vscp/rest?vscpsession=' + VscpSessionKey + '&format=jsonp&op=readevent&count=1',
            type : "GET",
            jsonpCallback: 'handler',
            cache: true,
            dataType: 'jsonp',
            success: function(response) {
                // response will be a JavaScript
                // array of objects
                console.log("-----------------------------------------------------------");
                console.log("                         do_readEventOne");
                console.log("-----------------------------------------------------------");
                console.log("Success = " + response.success );
                console.log("Code = " + response.code );
                console.log("Message = " + response.message );
                console.log("Description = " + response.description );
                console.log("Info = " + response.info );
                console.log("Count = " + response.count );
                console.log("Filtered = " + response.filtered );
                console.log("Errors = " + response.errors );
					
                if (  response.success && ( 1 == response.count ) ) {
                    $("#events").html( printEventData( response.event[0] ) );
                }					
					
            },
            error: function( xhr, status, error ) {
                console.log( "Close:" + error + " Status:" + status );
            }
        });
        }
        else {
            alert("Interface is not open!");
        }
};
`</code>`

If you want to read all events in the queue just set count to a very (insanely) high value.
